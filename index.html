# Step 0

Welcome back!

This week, we're going to work on working with
text. But in order to do that, we're going to 
need to have finished all the way through Step 3
of last week's exercises.

If you haven't finished that yet, feel free to
go back and finish that now, and we'll see you
when you're done.

> **REVIEW**: to proceed, go ahead and update
`step_0.js` to `log()` a message that says
"I finished Step 3 of Week 1", just to confirm
that you're all caught up!

# Step 1

Alright, let's talk about working with text!

## Strings - a quick review

We've worked with `strings` before, which is the
type of variable we use to represent text. You
can define a text value by wrapping it in quotes,
and you can do things like check the length of text:

```
let x = 'this is a string!';
let y = x.length; // 17
```

> **Check-in**: does it make sense why the value of `y`
is 17 in the above example? It's because the string `this is a string`
is 17 characters long (a "character" is a letter, a space, or the `!` in the
above example)

## Combining strings

When working with strings, some common operations like `+` take on a different
meaning. When you have something like `2+3`, that's basic math and equals `5`,
but when you add two strings together, you're telling the computer to combine
the strings together into a new longer string:

```
let x = 'Valor';
let y = ' ';
let z = 'North-Austin';

let schoolName = x + y + z; // 'Valor North-Austin'
```

> **Check-in**: what would happen if you just did `x+z` instead?
Instead, you would get `'ValorNorth-Austin'`, keep in mind that a space
counts as a character.

## Challenge Time

Ok, for the challenge for Step 1, we're going to write a simple function that
gets two strings as parameters, and:

* logs each string
* logs how long each string is
* combines the two strings into a single longer string
* logs that longer string
* logs how long that longer string is

Got all that? Awesome, let's get started!

> **Challenge**: update `step_1.js` to do the 5 criteria listed above

# Step 2

Let's chat real quick about empty strings:

## Empty strings

Suppose you had something like:

```
let x = '';
```

In this example, `x` is what we'd call an "empty" string,
a string of length `0`, which contains no characters.

**Why would we want this??**

Well, empty strings can be really helpful when used with the `+=` operator,
which takes a string value, adds something to the end of it, and assigns the
new longer value to the same variable. For example:

```
let x = '';
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    x += 'Banana';
}

// x == 'BananaBananaBanana'
```

So by starting with an empty string, we can then use some logic in our code
to make that string longer and more intersting by using `+=` to add parts of
the string to the end.

## Challenge: Leftpad

In the fall, I mentioned a famous method called `leftpad()`, that takes a string
and a desired length, and it returns the string with the proper number of spaces
in front of it so that the returned string is the desired length.

It's maybe easier to see with an example:

```
let x = leftpad('foo', 5); // x == '  foo'
let y = leftpad('foo', 6); // x == '   foo'
let z = leftpad('foo', 3); // x == 'foo'
```

For this challenge, you're going to implement this logic yourself!

* If `inputString` is shorter than `desiredLength`, the function should return
a new string that starts with the correct number of spaces, and ends with `inputString`
* If `inputString` is already longer than `desiredLength`, the function should
just return a string "ERROR"

> Open `step_2.js` and implement the logic in `leftpad()`!

Let's talk about a really powerful method: `split()`

## Splitting a string

You can call a method `split(' ')` on a string, and it will
look for all the spaces in that string, and split it up, returning
an array of smaller strings. Picture taking a newspaper, and a pair
of scissors, and cutting out each word in a paragraph:

```
let x = 'Valor North Austin';
let y = x.split(' ');

// y = ['Valor', 'North', 'Austin']
```

So in the above example, `y` is an array with 3 strings in it, and
the computer built that array by looking for the `' '` spaces, and
splitting up the original string `'Valor North Austin'`.

> **Check in**: what would the value of `'Coding Club'.split(' ')`
be? It would be an array with 2 strings in it: `['Coding', 'Club']`

Something really powerful is that you can call `split()` with things
other than spaces. For example, what if you wanted to split up a
string with a comma-separated list?

```
let x = 'One,Two,Three';

let y = x.split(',');

// y = ['One', 'Two', 'Three']
```

## Why splitting a string can be useful

If you split up a string into a bunch of smaller strings (for example,
all the words in the original string), you can answer some interesting
questions about the original string:

* How many words were in the original string?
* What was the 3rd word in the original string?
* How many times was a specific word used?

And with that in mind, let's get on to the challenge!

> **Challenge**: Open `step_3.js`, and implement the method so that it splits up `inputString`
into an array of words, and logs the right info about that original string
